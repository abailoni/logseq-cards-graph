- Write a convincing email where I should convince my brother to buy more plants for his garden, because gardening is healthy.
	- Dear Brother, 
	  I hope all is well and you have been enjoying your garden. I was thinking about you the other day and how much you love plants and gardening. I think you should buy more plants for your garden because gardening is healthy. Gardening has many benefits for mental and physical health. It can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. It can also help improve memory and concentration. Gardening is a great form of exercise because it requires lifting, digging, and walking. These activities can help improve your strength, flexibility, and balance. Additionally, being in nature has been shown to have a positive effect on mood and overall wellbeing. I think you would really enjoy having more plants in your garden. Not only would it be good for your health, but it would also make your garden look even more beautiful. I hope you take my advice and buy more plants for your garden. Sincerely, Your sister

	  Objects you own, they own you back. Explain me why
	  
	  Many people believe that the objects we own can have a hold on us and can even control us. This is because we can become so attached to our possessions that we cannot imagine life without them. We may feel like we need them in order to be happy or to feel fulfilled. Additionally, our possessions can take up a lot of our time and energy if we spend too much time worrying about them or taking care of them. In some cases, people can even become slaves to their possessions, spending all of their time and money on acquiring and maintaining them.
	  
	  Give me two examples of how our possessions can own us
	  
	  1. We may feel like we need them in order to be happy or to feel fulfilled.
	  
	  2. Our possessions can take up a lot of our time and energy if we spend too much time worrying about them or taking care of them.
