- Final idea:
	- For every observation image or species photo, create block with image and card tag
	- Then in the actual card I can embed the page of the actual plant, with properties hidden in clozes
		- In this way, I can easily associate, more observations to the same plant/page (and they will still show up in the page, by looking at the links! )
			- {{embed [[Some embedded page]]}}
		- On the top level of the card+picture (which will be added to journals), then i can add tags like plants, bird-id, properties, so that i can filter onlt certain csrds when doing spaced repetitions
	- Different sections of the plant page then will include curiosities, medicine, whatever
		- Also hidden in clozes in principle (when needed)
		- TODO i need to think how to query some flashcards only with medical properties or whateverâ€¦
	- Other things then involved habitats, relations between animals/plants
