- ### Ideas for the framework
	- Since organisms have a natural hierarchy, I guess it makes sense to create one using hierarchies, like [[Plant Kingdom/Another example]], to which I can also create some alias [[Another example]]
		- I could for example include few steps in the hierarchy, like family, subfamily, genus
		- In this case I definitely need some **script that imports a new species** from naturalist (**even without an observation**)
		- Names of the files should respect the naming rule (special characters converted to URL form, see https://github.com/logseq/logseq/pull/6134)
	- [[Selling-point]]
		- **General advantages**
			- Help you discover and get familiar with species of animals in your area
			- Local knowledge got lost and now it seems so difficult to catch back with things that our ancestors used to know very well…
		- **Application 1: Learn species and properties of plants from your observations**
			- > First observe with iNat and try to notice differences/details, then convert observations into Flashcards!
				- With space repetition, you will be much quicker at remembering plant families, medical properties,
				- iNat already has great taxa visualization, but here you can add your notes, observations
			- **Gamify It:**
				- Find who eats who!
				- Find a medical property of this plant!
				- Challenge: who can identify most local plants correctly?
		- **Application 2: Learn to recognise local birds by sound**
			- It is so tricky… You barely see them, often overlapped and very diverse..
				- Super time consuming: going on YouTube or finding local knowledge (often old websites not very user friendly), checking out a video (often forgotten after few days if you don’t keep working on it)
			- There is a nice Bird-ID app, but:
				- You need to pay for it
				- It is not local
				- It does not have spaced repetitions or more games
			- In practice:
				- Get list of species in local area
				- But gather sounds from bigger area, with several identifications from users (so that the sound has a better chance to be high quality)
		- **Other future ideas**
			- ==Create== fine-grained knowledge, or ==a framework where people can easily put stuff into==
				- *This species is often found together with…*
				- *Did you know that __ lives with ___…?*
				- Food webs or relations/symbiosis between animals
					- Or medical properties, stuff… Design it so that it will be easily expandable when users start putting more info in it
				- > Most of this info is already in Wikipedia and books, but it is not accessible or easily visualizable…
			- Possibly, make it community-like…? ==Maps or areas automatically deduced from google maps…?== (and that can be finetuned)
				- If you have info about certain area, include it
				- I need to **understand how types of areas are categorized**, so user can choose the most proper description (or local experts can initialize it for their area)
- Useful tool to get highlights from webpage:
	- https://danielwirtz.com/blog/logseq-web-highlighter
	- Example:
		- #### Pinus sylvestris - Wikipedia
		  tags:: [[web-page-highlights]]  
		  link:: [Pinus sylvestris - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_sylvestris)
			- Least ten years old and often kills trees it infects within a few weeks
			- This is another highlighted part
