- Since organisms have a natural hierarchy, I guess it makes sense to create one using hierarchies, like [[Plant Kingdom/Another example]], to which I can also create some alias [[Another example]]
	- I could for example include few steps in the hierarchy, like family, subfamily, genus
	- In this case I definitely need some **script that imports a new species** from naturalist (**even without an observation**)
	- Names of the files should respect the naming rule (special characters converted to URL form, see https://github.com/logseq/logseq/pull/6134)
- Some more random text to try git featuresâ€¦
