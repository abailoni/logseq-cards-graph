- Since organisms have a natural hierarchy, I guess it makes sense to create one using hierarchies, like [[Plant Kingdom/Another example]], to which I can also create some alias [[Another example]]
	- I could for example include few steps in the hierarchy, like family, subfamily, genus
	- In this case I definitely need some **script that imports a new species** from naturalist (**even without an observation**)
	- Names of the files should respect the naming rule (special characters converted to URL form, see https://github.com/logseq/logseq/pull/6134)
- Useful tool to get highlights from webpage:

	- Example:
		- #### Pinus sylvestris - Wikipedia
		  tags:: [[web-page-highlights]]  
		  link:: [Pinus sylvestris - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_sylvestris)
			- Least ten years old and often kills trees it infects within a few weeks
