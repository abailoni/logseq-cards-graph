- This is still shit on iOS, and now with Bear 2.0, this is clearly too much of a compromise, and for what...?
	- Just so that I can make appear some bullet points in multiple notes...?
		- Not worth, considering:
			- Forced to bullet points
			- Shitty search
			- Shitty iOS app (yes, it's still like that)
			- Not clear how it will handle lots of notes (Bear has no problem with that)
