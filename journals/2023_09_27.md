- *See you in one year or so ;)* Just wait, patience will pay off for sure. And in the meantime I can enjoy some new Bear tricks and backlinks or new methods to structure my notes. Remember, **the tool is only part of the equation**. In the meantime **I can start practicing these new methods in [[Bear]] and see which difficulties I encounter in practice**
- ## Summary
- ### Update on 27 Sept 23 (getting there...!)
	- Finally, proper "by-note or text" search has been added to the desktop app (but not there yet in the mobile version
	- iOS app:
		- Much improved (no more keyboard bug), although still crushing from time to time...
		- You can select and move blocks with gestures
		- MISSING key feature: no option to select multiple blocks (not nested) at once. Without this, copying and selecting stuff without a keyboard is a bit of a mess
		- Doubts: the new action keyboard of Bear 2 is really a killer feature...
