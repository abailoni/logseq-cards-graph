- ### Update on 27 Sept 23 (getting there...!)
- Finally, proper "by-note or text" search has been added to the desktop app (but not there yet in the mobile version
- iOS app:
	- Much improved (no more keyboard bug), although still crushing from time to time...
	- You can select and move blocks with gestures
	- MISSING key feature: no option to select multiple blocks (not nested) at once. Without this, copying and selecting stuff without a keyboard is a bit of a mess
	- Doubts: the new action keyboard of Bear 2 is really a killer feature...
